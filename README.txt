This is the working code for continuous attribute reduction using an improved version of the traditional K-Means algorithm. It aims to represent data effectively in decision tables.

The pipeline involves four main steps:
1) Normalization of the dataset
2) Conversion of the continuous attributes into discrete attributes by using an incremental version of the K-Means algorithm
3) Calculation of significance measures and entropy values of the discretized attributes
4) Retention of the significant attributes, elimination of the rest.
